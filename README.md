# Maze with Robot

## Overview
The **Maze with Robot** project is a JavaFX application designed to simulate the navigation of a robot and a car through various maze challenges. This application serves as an educational tool to understand algorithmic navigation and object-oriented programming principles. It provides a visual representation of the robot and car's movements, allowing users to engage interactively with the maze-solving process.

The project highlights the use of graphical user interface (GUI) design in JavaFX, basic animation techniques, and algorithmic problem-solving through the implementation of pathfinding algorithms. The overall aim is to offer an intuitive and interactive experience that showcases the capabilities of Java and JavaFX in building desktop applications.

## Project Features
- **Multiple Mazes**:
    - Users can switch between three distinct maze configurations, each presenting unique challenges and obstacles.
    - The mazes are designed with varying levels of complexity to test the robot's navigation capabilities.

- **Robot Navigation**:
    - A robot navigates each maze autonomously using a built-in pathfinding algorithm (such as A* or Dijkstra’s algorithm).
    - The algorithm's efficiency and effectiveness can be visualized in real-time as the robot finds its way to the exit.

- **Car Representation**:
    - A graphical representation of a car simulates movement through the maze, offering a different perspective on maze navigation.
    - Users can compare the movement strategies of the robot and the car to understand different approaches to navigation.

- **Interactive UI**:
    - The application features a user-friendly interface with buttons to start and stop solving the maze, allowing for an engaging experience.
    - Tooltips and instructions help guide users on how to interact with the application effectively.

- **Smooth Animations**:
    - Both the robot and car movements are animated smoothly, providing a visually appealing experience as they navigate through the maze.
    - The animations include transitions for starting and stopping, which enhances user interaction.

## Technologies Used
- **Java 22**: The core programming language used for the project, leveraging its robust platform for building desktop applications with modern features and capabilities.
- **JavaFX**: A powerful framework for building rich client applications in Java, providing advanced capabilities for handling graphics, media, and UI components.
- **Maven**: A project management and build automation tool that simplifies dependency management and project configuration, ensuring smooth builds and easy integration of external libraries.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
To run this project, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:
- **JDK 22** or higher
- **JavaFX SDK** (matching your JDK version)
- **Apache Maven** (for project build and dependency management)
- **IntelliJ IDEA** or another preferred IDE with JavaFX support

## Class Descriptions

- RobotMain.java: Contains the logic for the robot’s maze-solving functionality, including pathfinding algorithms and animation.
- CarMain.java: Handles the car’s navigation through the maze, providing a different perspective on the maze-solving process.
- Maze2Main.java: Implements an alternative maze for the user to interact with, showcasing different challenges.
- Robot.java: Defines the properties and methods for the robot, including movement and navigation logic.

## Usage

- Upon launching the application, you will see a tabbed interface with three tabs for each maze.
- Click the “Solve Maze” button to initiate the automatic solving of the maze.
- You can also use the arrow keys to manually move the robot within the maze.
