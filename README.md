# Maze with Robot

## Overview
The Maze with Robot project is a JavaFX application designed to simulate the navigation of a robot and a car through various mazes. This project provides a visual representation of algorithmic navigation and includes interactive elements to engage users. The application demonstrates object-oriented programming principles, JavaFX UI design, and basic animation techniques.

## Project Features
- **Multiple Mazes**: Users can switch between three different maze configurations, each presenting unique challenges.
- **Robot Navigation**: A robot that autonomously solves the maze using a pathfinding algorithm.
- **Car Representation**: A graphical representation of a car that simulates movement through the maze.
- **Interactive UI**: Buttons to start solving the maze, providing an engaging user experience.
- **Animation**: Smooth movement animations for both the robot and car as they navigate the mazes.

## Technologies Used
- **Java 22**: The programming language used for development.
- **JavaFX**: A powerful framework for building rich client applications in Java, providing a modern UI.
- **Maven**: A project management tool that simplifies the build process and dependency management.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
To run this project, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:
- **JDK 22** or higher
- **JavaFX SDK** (matching your JDK version)
- **Apache Maven** (for project build and dependency management)
- **IntelliJ IDEA** or another preferred IDE with JavaFX support

## Class Descriptions

- RobotMain.java: Contains the logic for the robot’s maze-solving functionality, including pathfinding algorithms and animation.
- CarMain.java: Handles the car’s navigation through the maze, providing a different perspective on the maze-solving process.
- Maze2Main.java: Implements an alternative maze for the user to interact with, showcasing different challenges.
- Robot.java: Defines the properties and methods for the robot, including movement and navigation logic.

## Usage

- Upon launching the application, you will see a tabbed interface with three tabs for each maze.
- Click the “Solve Maze” button to initiate the automatic solving of the maze.
- You can also use the arrow keys to manually move the robot within the maze.
